# XAI

| Aspect               | Traditional XAI                                      | SOM-Based Explanations                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope**            | Local (instance-specific)                            | Global (map-wide, concept-level)                                   |
| **Explanation Type** | Feature attribution                                  | Conceptual clustering and labeling                                 |
| **Output**           | Ranked feature contributions                         | Interpretable map regions with labels                              |
| **Human Alignment**  | Abstract, often numerical or statistical             | Visual, spatial, and concept-driven                                |
| **Generalization**   | Limited to single cases                              | Supports conceptual generalization                                 |
| **Cognitive Load**   | High—requires expert interpretation                  | Lower—intuitive for domain experts and decision-makers             |
| **Use Cases**        | Explaining individual outcomes (e.g., loan approval) | Categorizing and understanding classes (e.g., patient risk levels) |
| **Transparency**     | Post-hoc approximation                               | Inherent to the model structure                                    |
